    <Feature name="Correlated Funds">
        <UserStory>
            As a user, I can find which ticker from a given sample most correlates with a target ticker or index
            so that I can decide which fund to use when trading the underlying index.
        </UserStory>
        <Example>
            Technical Analysis indicates that the Home Builders industry may outperform the market.
            Using this feature, I can find the fund which best tracks a Home Builders index, which itself cannot be traded.
